## Overview

[The Metaverse](https://metaverse.jeev.me) is a multimedia research essay that aims to explore whether the metaverse would fundamentally benefit human society. This website was developed as part of a semester-long Mentored Advanced Project for the Digital Studies concentration at Grinnell College.

It is organized into three parts, with each focused on a broad theme/question:

1. **Identity** — How would the metaverse shape notions of identity?
2. **Reality** — How would the metaverse shift our perception of reality?
3. **Capitalism** — What is the relationship between the metaverse and capitalism?
