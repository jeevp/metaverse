Today, it refers to an evolving vision for the future of the internet.","intro1":"Until recently, the term “metaverse” was relatively unknown. In his 1992 science fiction novel Snow Crash, Neil Stephenson coined the term to imagine a parallel universe where people congregate to escape the dystopian real world. Almost thirty years later, in October 2021, Facebook announced it was changing its name to Meta to signify a new goal: “bring[ing] the metaverse to life.” Overnight, “metaverse” entered the public lexicon, sparking conversations about the potential—both positive and negative—of this new technology.","intro2":"The word “metaverse” is a portmanteau of the Greek prefix “meta-,” which translates to “beyond” and is used in English to mean a more comprehensive version of something. In this case, the prefix is followed by “verse,” an abbreviation of the English “universe,” the totality of space and matter. This etymology points to a vague definition of the metaverse as a new universe that allows us to transcend the limits of physicality. More practically, we can define the metaverse as an iteration of the internet consisting of a shared, immersive digital space accessed using extended reality technology.  This definition of the metaverse, which resembles the plans outlined by Meta and other technology companies, relies on a few key features:","keyCharacteristics":[{"name":"Persistence","description":"Users can generate avatars (physical representations in the metaverse) and own assets. Different virtual worlds are interconnected, enabling users to seamlessly transition between them while retaining the same identity."},{"name":"Immersion","description":"Some environments faithfully replicate the real world, while others opt to free users from physical constraints like time, space, and gravity. Technologies like augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (XR) allow for varying levels of immersion."},{"name":"Decentralization","description":"Users will own their personal data, identity, and digital assets across metaverse platforms. Technologies like blockchain and cryptocurrency may be key to metaverse-enabled transactions."}],"intro3":"Right now, the metaverse isn’t quite so cohesive. It consists of fragmented virtual/augmented reality spaces like video games and 3D social spaces, which involve interactions between user-generated avatars and computer-generated entities. There are numerous questions about the technological feasibility of creating the kind of metaverse described above, and user interest in the metaverse seems lower than anticipated.","intro4":"However, the metaverse isn’t going anywhere. Meta plans to invest another $20 billion USD in the metaverse in 2023, and Apple is expected to release a AR/VR headset later this year. Whether or not the metaverse ever fully materializes, it’s clear that tech companies believe in the metaverse. Some share this perspective that the metaverse is an inevitable step into the future, but many are concerned about ethical, philosophical, and environmental implications. This essay seeks to explore questions about how the metaverse came to be, how it will operate, and how it will affect us and shape the societies in which we live.","https":"//www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0262407922000185","historyHook":"Where did the idea of the metaverse come from?","historyByline":"While the metaverse has emerged as a concept in art, literature, and pop culture, technology has evolved to support its creation.","timelineData":[{"name":"COVID-19 Pandemic","start":"December 2019","end":"Today","type":"background","fuzzy":"true"},{"name":"Information Age","start":"January 1, 1970","end":"Today","type":"background","fuzzy":"true","Sources":"","https":"//www.mdpi.com/2673-8392/2/1/31"},{"name":"Snow Crash coins the term “metaverse”","start":"June 1992","description":"In his science fiction novel Snow Crash, Neal Stephenson coins the term “metaverse” to describe a virtual-reality based world.
