Today, it refers to an evolving vision for the future of the internet.","intro1":"Until recently, the term “metaverse” was relatively unknown. In his 1992 science fiction novel Snow Crash, Neil Stephenson coined the term to imagine a parallel universe where people congregate to escape the dystopian real world. Almost thirty years later, in October 2021, Facebook announced it was changing its name to Meta to signify a new goal: “bring[ing] the metaverse to life.” Overnight, “metaverse” entered the public lexicon, sparking conversations about the potential—both positive and negative—of this new technology.","intro2":"The word “metaverse” is a portmanteau of the Greek prefix “meta-,” which translates to “beyond” and is used in English to mean a more comprehensive version of something. In this case, the prefix is followed by “verse,” an abbreviation of the English “universe,” the totality of space and matter. This etymology points to a vague definition of the metaverse as a new universe that allows us to transcend the limits of physicality. More practically, we can define the metaverse as an iteration of the internet consisting of a shared, immersive digital space accessed using extended reality technology.  This definition of the metaverse, which resembles the plans outlined by Meta and other technology companies, relies on a few key features:","keyCharacteristics":[{"name":"Persistence","description":"Users can generate avatars (physical representations in the metaverse) and own assets. Different virtual worlds are interconnected, enabling users to seamlessly transition between them while retaining the same identity."},{"name":"Immersion","description":"Some environments faithfully replicate the real world, while others opt to free users from physical constraints like time, space, and gravity. Technologies like augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (XR) allow for varying levels of immersion."},{"name":"Decentralization","description":"Users will own their personal data, identity, and digital assets across metaverse platforms. Technologies like blockchain and cryptocurrency may be key to metaverse-enabled transactions."}],"intro3":"Right now, the metaverse isn’t quite so cohesive. It consists of fragmented virtual/augmented reality spaces like video games and 3D social spaces, which involve interactions between user-generated avatars and computer-generated entities. There are numerous questions about the technological feasibility of creating the kind of metaverse described above, and user interest in the metaverse seems lower than anticipated.","intro4":"However, the metaverse isn’t going anywhere. Meta plans to invest another $20 billion USD in the metaverse in 2023, and Apple is expected to release a AR/VR headset later this year. Whether or not the metaverse ever fully materializes, it’s clear that tech companies believe in the metaverse. Some share this perspective that the metaverse is an inevitable step into the future, but many are concerned about ethical, philosophical, and environmental implications.

The word avatar is derived from the Sanskrit word <em>avatāra</em>, which refers to the embodiment of a deity in human form. Since the 1970s, this word has been used in computing to describe a user’s graphical representation in digital space. Whether a small profile picture or a realistic three-dimensional model, an avatar is key to digital identity and social interaction online.","avatarCustomization":"In the metaverse, digital identities are built by both platforms and users. Different metaverse platforms employ different approaches—user avatars can vary significantly in anthropomorphism, realism, and customizability. For example, Sandbox uses humanoid avatars composed of blocky shapes, while Meta’s Horizon Worlds is populated by floating, leg-less cartoon humans. However, most metaverse platforms take inspiration from role-playing video games, which often allow users to customize their avatar’s appearance.","customizationBenefits":"For many (like James), the ability to build a new identity from scratch is an alluring feature of the metaverse. Altering one’s virtual appearance opens up possibilities to reinvent oneself entirely — for example, the metaverse might represent exploration and fluidity for people who want to experiment with gender expression. Some might even suggest that one’s physical body and digital identity can become fully separate, making the metaverse operate as a truly parallel world.","identityRebuttal":"However, many argue that this idea is mistakenly rooted in the “myth of cyberspace”: the notion that digital identity is something disembodied and totally distinct from real-world, physical existence. More often than not, dimensions of identity that exist in the real world are replicated in virtual ones. Let us revisit the example of customizing one’s avatar. Experimentation with one’s appearance might be affirming, but it can also fall into the territory of appropriation and tokenization. Scholar Lisa Nakamura calls this “identity tourism,” the phenomenon of race- and gender-swapping in cyberspace.","identityTourism":"When a user engages in identity tourism, they can temporarily access a new identity while remaining immune to the consequences that exist in the physical world. This becomes damaging when that user “performs” as a particular race or gender in the metaverse by drawing from harmful real-world stereotypes. It can also trigger mental health issues like body dysmorphia, as users create idealized versions of themselves and experience confusion around self-image.","identityIssues":"Even in the absence of identity tourism, real-world issues around identity are already emerging in the metaverse. Research shows that most human avatars tend to mimic mainstream Western beauty standards, suggesting our perception of physical bodies and virtual avatars are difficult to tease apart. Some NFT avatars are being priced differently based on their race and gender, showing how discrimination can take form in metaverse economies.","harassment":"Perhaps the most concrete example is the issue of sexual harassment. There are numerous examples of users in various metaverse worlds (like Meta’s Horizon Worlds platform) being groped in virtual reality. According to researcher Katherine Cross, the immersive nature of VR makes this type of harassment much more emotionally potent than other forms of online harassment. Because virtual reality is designed to intensify embodiment, the psychological response to virtual trauma is close to that of real-world trauma.","idDescription1":"James lives in Boise, Idaho, and works in construction.
